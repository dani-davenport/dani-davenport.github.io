# About Me

My name is Dani Davenport.

I am a researcher interested in population genomics with applications to conservation and management of marine resources. I am currently a postdoc at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography with Fisheries and Oceans Canada - co-supervised by Ian Bradbury and Claudio DiBacco. 

I completed my PhD in 2022 at the University of Queensland, Australia, Molecular Fisheries Lab. My PhD thesis - *Applications of genomic methods to investigate shark populations of conservation concern* - presented a contemporary and retrospective genomic analysis to contribute to and improve the monitoring and conservation of sharks, guided by current and relevant conservation and management questions.
