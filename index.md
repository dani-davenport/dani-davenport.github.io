# Hey!

My name is Dani Davenport.

I am a PhD researcher at the University of Queensland, Australia, where I work in the Molecular Fisheries Lab apply genomic methods and theory to the management and conservation of marine populations. My PhD thesis - "Applications of genomic methods to investigate shark populations of conservation concern - will present a contemporary and retrospective genomic analysis to contribute to and improve the monitoring and conservation of sharks guided by current and relevant conservation and management questions.

I am currently living in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
