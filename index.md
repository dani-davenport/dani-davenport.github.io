# About Me

My name is Dani Davenport.

I am interested in population genomics with applications to conservation and management of marine resources. I am currenlty a post doctoral Research Scientist at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, where I am co-supervised by Ian Bradbury and Claudio DiBacco. 

I completed my PhD in 2022 at the University of Queensland, Australia, Molecular Fisheries Lab. My PhD thesis - *Applications of genomic methods to investigate shark populations of conservation concern* - presented a contemporary and retrospective genomic analysis, guided by current and relevant conservation and management questions, to improve the monitoring and conservation of sharks.
