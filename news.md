## RCN MarineOmics Working Group <br>
*Dec 2020*<br>
I've joined the [MarineOmics Working Group](https://marineomics.github.io/)! The working group is part of the [RCN for Evolution in Changing Seas](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/) and was formed to promote reproducible and robust genomic research in marine science. I'll be working as a mentor to undergraduate interns who will systematically review the marine-genomics peer-reviewed literature to summarise the state of reproducibility in the field. I will also work to write reproducbible pipelines as part of a sub-commitee for genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) (i.e. ddRAD).<br>

## NOAA Internship <br>
*Feb-March 2020*<br>
I interned at the Northwest Fisheries Science Centre, NOAA in Seattle. The internship is run through the Univeristy of Queenslands HDR Graduade Program. As part of the internship I am working on an ongoing project in collaboration with Prof. Robin Waples examining the relationship between migration and allele frequency   change using simulations. Check out the github repo for the project [here](https://github.com/tunaloveheart/Migration_Simulations).
