I am a PhD researcher working in the Molecular Fisheries Laboratory at the University of Queensland investigating global populations of  sharks across temporal and spatial scales. Experienced student mentor and tutor; adept in R, python and bash scripting, with an emphasis on population genomic analysis for conservation and management outcomes.

**Tutors@UQ, University of Queensland**
The University of Queensland, St Lucia
- Teaching Assistant

Currently working as a teaching assistant delivering course content at the undergraduate and masters level. I teach into courses including Analysis and communication of Biological Data implementing skills in statistical and mathematical modelling and R-scripting. Introduction to Bioinformatics (masters level) tutoring technical skills in Galaxy, bash scripting, HPC use and bioinformatics concepts. Introduction to Bioinformatics (undergraduate level) tutoring skills in computing including bash-scripting, python and bioinformatics algorithms. Advanced Bioinformatics (masters & undergraduate level) tutoring technical skills in python, algorithms and bioinformatics concepts. Introduction to Cell Biology (undergraduate level) tutoring students in the use of histology to answer scientific questions.

*2020 (Jan-March)*
**UQ Graduate School Career Development Intern, NOAA, Seattle, Washington, USA**
North West Fisheries Science Center, NOAA, Seattle
Intern

Working under Prof. Robin Waples, utilizing individual level genomic population simulations to address the conundrum of genetic distance and demographic independence for applications to fisheries management.

*2017 – Current*         
**Molecular Fisheries Laboratory, University of Queensland**
School of Biomedical Sciences, St Lucia, Queensland
PhD Student

PhD student on Project GenoJaws where her focus is contemporary and retrospective genomic analysis of white sharks. Work collaboratively with various data sets (genetic, temporal, environmental, morphological) to understand populations of marine species under the supervision of Prof. Jenny Ovenden. I has worked on population level projects for both conservation of species and commercial fisheries, and works as part of a broader group consulting on government reports and fisheries projects.

*2016-2017*         
**Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute (TRI)**
- Brisbane, Queensland
- UQ Advantage Scholarship Summer Intern

Working under Dr. Kim-Ahn Le Cao. Utilizing R, command line and python tools to test and implement mixOmics (multi-‘omic’ statistical methods) on biological data. Responsible for writing and publishing web content; maintaining and creating web tutorials; monitoring and responding to user-queries/technical issues.

*2014-2015*         
**Australian Seafood Industries (ASI)**
- Hobart, Tasmania
- Research Officer Assistant

Contributed to selective breeding research for disease resistance, phenotype and growth characteristics in Pacific Oysters. Danielle worked closely with both industry and research organizations including IMAS & CSIRO.
